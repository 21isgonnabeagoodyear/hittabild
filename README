Image sorter following the unix philosophy of worse is better.  

BEFORE USING YOU MUST
-create folder thumbs
-create a new repository
-add some photos

create a repository with 
python main.py newdb

add photos with
python main.py add filename1 filename2 etc
photos can only be added via the command line

view photos with
python main.py

gui will be slow until thumbnails have been generated, you can generate them manually with
python main.py makethumbs



   REQUIREMENTS
Core:
python 2.7 ish
pygtk 2.x

Recommended:
exiftool and exiftool python module (module is included)
ufraw (raw thumbnail support)
xcf2pnm (xcf thumbnail support and viewing)
imagemagick convert (other thumbnail support)

Supported editors/viewers:
imagemagick display
xterm (for exif viewing)
feh
ufraw
delaboratory (need zenity)
gimp (need zenity)


   KEYS
hjkl         move active selection
op           change editor
]            next version
dbl click    open with selected editor
r dbl click  open with viewer
m dbl click  open fullsize viewer
t dbl click  view exif (this is the thumb button on my g500, your mouse may not have this button or it may be somewhere else)
/            focus search bar
:            focus tag bar
delete       move to trash
012345       rate
!            reload thumbnail and creation date (NOTE: creation date is taken from the oldest version)


   NOTES
tags starting with # are typically added automatically or used by the program (you can add them manually if you want)
#hidden will hide the image from the default view
you can use OR and NOT in the search bar for more precise searching (AND is the default, evaluated left to right)
by default tagging appends instead of overwriting
no way to delete things from the trash so get a bigger hard drive
when editing with delaboratory or gimp, save your tiff or xcf to the filename given by the zenity window to have it automatically added as a new version when you exit delaboratory or click the ok button for gimp
