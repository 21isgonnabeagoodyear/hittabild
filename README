Image sorter following the unix philosophy of worse is better.  

you must create the folder "thumbs" before using

create a repository with 
python main.py newdb

add photos with
python main.py add filename1 filename2 etc

view photos with
python main.py

gui will be slow until thumbnails have been generated, you can generate them manually with
python main.py makethumbs

Core:
python 2.7 ish
pygtk 2.x

   NOTES
tags starting with # are typically added automatically or used by the program (you can add them manually if you want)
by default tagging appends instead of overwriting
no way to delete things from the trash so get a bigger hard drive
when editing with delaboratory, save your tiff to the filename given by the zenity window to have it automatically added as a new version when you exit delaboratory
